# PFFP_Prediction

This repository features a model that classifies sediments into four distinct categories while also providing uncertainty estimates. By integrating Random Forest and 1D Bayesian Convolutional Neural Network algorithms, this model delivers robust sediment classification with probabilistic ranges for each prediction, aiding in more informed decision-making in coastal engineering.

You can easily use the model by following the instructions in the `PFFP_Prediction.ipynb` notebook. The notebook can be downloaded and run offline, or you can execute it directly on Kaggle without needing to install anything. A Kaggle link is embedded at the top of the notebook for convenience.

For offline use, you can download the trained models from this link: (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1sY4tHhB5ftP5-MwiYf1wpipRCGk0EqBx?usp=sharing).

An example PFFP dataset, which can be used as input for the model, is available here: (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1m-2vKbMwpNUabCEwzTPDyQb4wqdHtUZv?usp=sharing).
